        <p>Tuna Mayo Onigiri is a modern take on traditional Japanese rice balls, stuffed with canned tuna seasoned with Japanese-style mayonnaise and soy sauce. 
            The combo was first popularized by the Japanese convenience store chain 7-Eleven in the early 1980s. 
            Over the past 40 years it has grown to become the most popular flavor of onigiri in Japan, surpassing more classic flavors like umeboshi (pickled plum) and tarako (cod roe).</p>

        <h2><em>Ingredients</em></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Rice</li>
            <li>Tuna</li>
            <li>Mayonnaise</li>
            <li>Soy Sauce</li>
            <li>Nori Seaweed Sheets</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><em>Steps</em></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash and cook the rice either in the rice cooker or on the stove.</li>
            
            <li>While you wait for the rice, you can prepare the tuna mayo filling by opening and draining the can of tuna and adding it to a bowl with the mayonnaise and soy sauce. 
                Stir this together well until there are no big chunks of tuna remaining. </li>
            
            <li>You'll also want to prepare a bowl of water to wet your hands with, and a bowl of salt to season the outside of the onigiri. </li>
           
            <li>After your rice is done cooking and steaming, use a spatula or rice paddle to fluff the rice using a folding  and cutting motion. 
                Use a light touch, and be careful not to smash or break the individual grains of rice.</li>
            
            <li>The rice is going to be too hot to shape into a rice ball, so transfer it to a bowl and cover it with a damp towel until it's still hot, but not so hot that you will burn yourself. 
                This is important because the rice becomes stickier and harder to shape as it cools, and you want to be able to shape it without squeezing and compacting it too much. </li>
            
            <li>Once the rice has cooled enough to handle, wet both hands by dunking them in the bowl of water you prepared. Dip your index finger in the bowl of salt. 
                Don't be shy here, as some of this pinch of salt is going to make its way onto the outside of your onigiri to season it. Rub the salt between your hands to distribute it evenly. </li>
            
            <li>Cup one hand and scoop one-sixth of the rice into the palm. Poke a hole into the center of the mound of rice and scoop about two teaspoons of tuna mixture into the hole. </li>

            <li>Cover the filling up with the rice around the edges, and then fold your fingers over, so your hand forms a u-shape. 
                Use two fingers from your other hand to mold an upside-down v-shape and press it into the rice cupped hand.</li>
            
            <li>Rotate the triangle onto another side and repeat the cupping and shaping to form an equilateral triangle (3 equal sides). Repeat until you're happy with the shape, 
                but be careful not to compress the rice too much, or your rice ball will be very dense and heavy. </li>
            
            <li>Wrap your Tuna Mayo Onigiri with a wild sesame leaf or nori sheet and repeat the process with the rest of the rice. </li>
        </ol>
